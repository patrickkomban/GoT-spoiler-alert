# GoT-spoiler-alert
My very first attempt at a very simple Chrome extension to alert the user of potential 
Game of Thrones spoilers on a web page!

When the extension is clicked upon, a simple UI is presented with a button
that replaces all (or at least most) images on the web page to an 
appropriate spoiler alert image.

The main improvement that I would've liked with this extension is the ability
to actually redact some of the text that could be spoilers, but at the moment
it only searches the web page for a match of the string 'game of thrones'

I would also like to implement a functionality for disabling the extension 
using the UI as the alternative is for the user to go into their extensions
and disable it manually.
